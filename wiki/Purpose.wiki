#summary Purpose

= Introduction =

What started as an April Fool joke by Google for 2008 is now a real and genuine effort by an increasing number of people to create ideas and ways in which humankind can live sustainably in space using free and open source technology. This project is a place for all space enthusiasts to cooperate on simulations of space habitats and a related knowledgebase and tools for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) using Jython and other JVM languages. Rather than argue whether L5 or Mars or the asteroids or the Moon or the rings of Saturn should be humankind's first space settlement, we could be asking what is common between those efforts so that that groundwork can be shared.

Think of it as potentially supporting all these other more focused groups,
like proposed here:
  "A Review of Licensing and Collaborative Development with Special Attention to Design of Self-Replicating Space Habitat Systems"

"One reason more cooperation on such a library hasn't happened to date is that the various societies people support have (seemingly) very different objectives. For example, numerous space-settlement related efforts (such as SSI http://www.ssi.org/, the Mars Society http://www.marssociety.org, the Living Universe Foundation http://www.luf.org, PERMANENT http://www.permanent.com, and the Artemis Project http://www.asi.org) each have a different approach towards space settlement. Since so many bright people want similar things, the question arises of how we can work together to help all of these projects develop. Rather than argue whether L5 or Mars or the asteroids or the Moon or the rings of Saturn should be humankind's first space settlement, we could be asking what is common between those efforts so that that groundwork can be shared."
