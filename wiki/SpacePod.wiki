#summary Proposed first design/simulation: utility space pod

= Introduction =

The "shirtsleeve" utility space pod is probably common to all space efforts. Any project that we attempt in space will require extended periods of construction or repair in a Zero-G environment.

Spacesuits, while advantageous in tight environments, are inadequate to jobs lasting more than a few hours. This is because they are inadequate protection from micrometeorites and other spaceborne debris, and the maneuverability requirements of a suit limit the oxygen supply size that can be attached. 

The space pod allows for a larger and more rigid protective shell, room for greater air supply, as well as room for a more numerous and varied assortment of tools.

Space Pod has mining attachment currently; alternate arm is beside it, ready for changeover after lunch.

Can you spot the safety violation in the picture?

Maybe this person might free this utility space pod VRML as a starting point
if asked?

"Ever wish you could explore the worlds in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey?
Now you can, in 3D!  These models were created in VRML (Virtual Reality
Modeling Language). Sit inside the Orion III cockpit and watch the moving
navigation displays as you rendezvous with Space Station Five. Also, walk
inside the Space Station Five hotel lobby! Get a close look at the Discovery
spacecraft; click on the pod bay doors to open them. Sit inside a Space Pod
and fly it around the Discovery."

Or we can re-engineer from scratch as free?

With ever more detail in successive iterations?

And then a parts list and production/mining logistics web?

Maybe someday a physical simulator?
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_simulator
"A flight simulator is a system that tries to copy, or simulate, the
experience of flying an aircraft. It is as realistic as possible. The
different types of flight simulator range from video games up to full-size
cockpit replicas mounted on hydraulic (or electromechanical) actuators,
controlled by state of the art computer technology."
