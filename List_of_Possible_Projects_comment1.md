Communications should be considered. SCPS (Space Communication Protocol Standards) is a specific implementation of IPN (Inner Planetary networking) that requires applications to be able to deal with DTN (Delay Tolerant Networking) concepts as well as a store and forward encrypted communication mechanism. There are several links in google for the above so I'll let you guys research to know how this all works. Bottom line is, all application communication with 'long distance' space networks can be either direct (requiring lots of power at each end) or through a series of relays (space routers?) and end up with the equivalent of UUCP with 4d (location + timing) coordinates for relay communication. Space capable apps will need to be able to communicate by sending a self encapsulated message and if a reply is required, be capable of waiting for a long time to receive it. (Think speed of light delays)
